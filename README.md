# 🏗️ Modern Data Warehouse Project (Medallion Architecture)

## 📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **Modern Data Warehouse** using the **Medallion Architecture** — structured into **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.

### Key Components:
- **🗂️ Data Architecture:** Implemented using the Medallion approach for scalability and data quality.
- **⚙️ ETL Pipelines:** Extract, transform, and load data from multiple source systems into the warehouse.
- **🧩 Data Modeling:** Designed **Fact** and **Dimension** tables optimized for analytical queries.
- **📊 Analytics & Reporting:** Created SQL-based reports and dashboards to derive actionable business insights.

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
This project is ideal for professionals and students aiming to showcase expertise in:

- SQL Development  
- Data Architecture  
- Data Engineering  
- ETL Pipeline Development  
- Data Modeling  
- Data Analytics  

---

## 🧱 Data Architecture
The data architecture follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold) for a structured data processing pipeline.

### 🥉 Bronze Layer
- Stores **raw data** as-is from source systems.  
- Data ingested directly from **CSV files** into a **SQL Server Database**.

### 🥈 Silver Layer
- Focuses on **data cleansing, standardization, and normalization**.  
- Ensures data consistency and prepares it for downstream analytics.

### 🥇 Gold Layer
- Contains **business-ready data** modeled into a **Star Schema**.  
- Optimized for reporting, dashboards, and advanced analytics.

---

## 📈 Deliverables
- End-to-end **ETL pipeline** for data ingestion and transformation  
- **Optimized star schema** for analytics  
- **SQL reports** and **visual dashboards** for data insights  

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **SQL Server**
- **Python (for ETL scripting)**
- **Power BI / Tableau** (for visualization)
- **Excel / CSV** (data sources)

---

### 🏁 Conclusion
This project provides a complete, practical implementation of modern data warehousing principles and serves as a strong **portfolio project** for roles in **Data Engineering**, **Analytics**, and **Architecture**.
